    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We built <a href="http://jobsuitors.com">Jobsuitors</a> with our friends in mind. We saw them agonizing over their resumes and sending out endless cover letters. They punched their information into dime-a-dozen internet resume sites that mass-emailed it to random companies - ignoring their specialized skills, their social networks, and their preferences. So much time is wasted without producing good results. We thought there had to be a better way.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Jobsuitors takes the job search and turns it on its head. We have painstakingly (and lovingly) set up a comprehensive system that matches jobseekers to employers. Jobseekers finally have one platform where they can input all of their information, find jobs that they actually want, and effortlessly apply. Meanwhile, employers can automate the process of posting positions, filtering through candidates, and vetting them. Both jobseekers and employers can pick multiple factors in our innovative search engine and weigh how much each one matters to them.</p>

<p>So you want a job where you can code while drinking a beer? You got it. Want to work in a competitive environment on Wall Street and still get paid maternity leave? Done. Want an employee who’ll figure out the company’s next big idea and beat everyone at foosball? We’ve got you covered.</p>

<p>We believe that the job search doesn’t have to be miserable. That hidden underneath all of the bureaucracy and red tape, there’s excitement to be had - the thrill of discovery. We believe in a process that’s more efficient, more effective, and more fun.</p>

<p>The time has come, friends. Let’s find you the one that fits.</p>

<p>See you on the other side,</p>

<p>The Jobsuitors Team</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of poetry recently. It&#8217;s been a great way to relax
after working at Synapse all day and then coming home and working on
Jobsuitors all night. I&#8217;ve also wanted to improve my Bengali, so I started
reading more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore">Tagore</a>.
Here&#8217;s my translation of one of my favorites:</p>

<!-- more -->


<pre><code>In desperate hope I go and search for her 
in all the corners of my room; 
I find her not. 

My house is small 
and what once has gone from it can never be regained. 

But infinite is thy mansion, my lord, 
and seeking her I have to come to thy door. 

I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky 
and I lift my eager eyes to thy face. 

I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish 
---no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears. 

Oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, 
plunge it into the deepest fullness. 
Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch 
in the allness of the universe.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The avenue to an exciting new field of study has finally been opened. For the first time in almost two millenia we&#8217;ve been able to objectively measure the effects of alcohol on a persons ability to perform tasks. We can only do this because of the metric provided to us by the great developers at zetamac.com, whose arithmetic game is what we use for this experiment.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We take 2 test subjects (we could only find 2 subjects who agreed to take part in this risky and incredibly nerdy venture) and compare their score on the Zetamac Arithmetic game, a game in which players answer as many basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division questions within 2 minutes. The web apps update speed leaves almost no room for error, and we can assign an uncertainty of ±2 for the score. We compare the score from the 2 subjects as they take shots of rum and vodka, and after each shot, they redo the arithmetic game. We assume here that rum and vodka contain the same alcohol percentage. An uncertainty of ±0.2 is assigned to the shot amounts because of inconsistencies in pouring of the alcohol.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Round</th>
      <th>Subject A</th>
      <th>Subject B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>63</td>
      <td>56</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>67</td>
      <td>52</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>60</td>
      <td>47</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>66</td>
      <td>44</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>59</td>
      <td>56</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>65</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>60</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>65</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<p>From the collected data, it can be seen that the compatibility of the test subjects was not optimal. Subject B did not want to do more than three shots, and this caused a scarceness of data points. In Science, we call subject B a “bitch.” We will define the meaning of this word in the glossary of the report.</p>

<p>We try therefore to model what would happen to both subjects in subsequent shots. We see that Subject B was following a linear model with a negative slope; however, Subject A’s performance was erratic and difficult for us to explain. The points almost formed a sinusoidal function. We therefore attempted to model Subject A’s predicted performances with a sinusoidal function. Here are the results:</p>

<p><img class="img-polaroid pull-left" src="http://www.samiurr.com/images/alcohollab.jpg" style="margin: 12px 0" width="554px"/></p>

<p>We see, as expected, that Subject B reaches score of 0 (equivalent to death) at about 13-14 drinks. However, the sinusoidal function that models Subject A’s performance shows a rather incredible result. According to the model, Subject A will continue to perform at about his average, no matter how much he drinks. This in itself has amazing implications. This experiment maybe the first step to show that alcoholism is perfectly fine for certain individuals.</p>

<p>We conclude this experiment in great glee. We are currently working on a second experiment, the effects of binge drinking on sniping performance (in video games of course). We also plan on doing studies with more test subjects, bribing them with free alcohol, and then using those results to compare with our initial test data. We hope to prove conclusively that alcoholism is not necessarily detrimental to health and sanity. We will be back soon to report on our findings.</p>
