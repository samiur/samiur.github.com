I've been reading a lot of poetry recently. It's been a great way to relax
after working at Synapse all day and then coming home and working on 
Jobsuitors all night. I've also wanted to improve my Bengali, so I started
reading more [Tagore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore).
Here's my translation of one of my favorites:

<!-- more -->

    In desperate hope I go and search for her 
    in all the corners of my room; 
    I find her not. 

    My house is small 
    and what once has gone from it can never be regained. 

    But infinite is thy mansion, my lord, 
    and seeking her I have to come to thy door. 

    I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky 
    and I lift my eager eyes to thy face. 

    I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish 
    ---no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears. 

    Oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, 
    plunge it into the deepest fullness. 
    Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch 
    in the allness of the universe.
