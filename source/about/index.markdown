I consider myself to be a citizen of the world. My father was a
diplomat and I've lived in 5 countries, and have traveled to over
30. I learned my English in England; so, even though I've
assimilated to an American accent, if you get me drunk enough,
you'll hear my British accent come back.

New York is the city that I've lived in the longest by far, and
it's my favorite place in the world (although, Seattle is starting
to give it a run for it's money). I went to school there too, at
the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, where I
studied Electrical and Computer Engineering. Since then, I've moved 
to Seattle, and have sort of fallen in love with it's beauty and it's
people, most of which are transplants like me.

I also love music, books and knowledge in general. My life's
passion may be to solve problems, of all sorts.

I am interested in working on Cognitive Radio Technologies to optimize 
the highly inefficient spectrum allocation methods used in the field today.
I am also interested in the development of new network algorithms for 
communications in ad hoc network environments. 

In Computer Science, I am interested in new and innovative software 
development that uses Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and 
complex algorithms.
