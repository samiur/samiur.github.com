<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I consider myself to be a citizen of the world. My father was a
  diplomat and I've lived in 5 countries, and have traveled to over
  30. I learned my English in England; so, even though I've
  assimilated to an American accent, if you get me drunk enough,
  you'll hear my British accent come back.</p>
<p>I also love music, books and knowledge in general. My life's
  passion may be to solve problems, of all sorts.<p>
